# Tiny-Language-Compiler
In this project, I was asked to write a recursive descent LL(1) parser and code generator for the tinyL language. The compiler generates RISC machine instructions. You will also write a code optimizer that
takes RISC machine instructions as input and removes redundant code. The output of the optimizer is a sequence of RISC machine instructions which produces the same results as the
original input sequence but is more efficient.
